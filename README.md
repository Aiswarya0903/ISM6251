# Data Science Programming
## My projects in Spring ISM6251 Data Science Programming 

## Skills : Python(Machine learning techniques, superwised learning, unsuperwised learning, Predictions and Data analysis)

### Programming for data science.Exploring large data sets to find valuable insights that might guide organizations in making decisions has been an amazing experience.

Data Science Programming Projects

WEEK01 Data prep: Used different encoding techniques to prepare data for analysis

WEEK02-Regression:

                1. Increase the amount of noise added to the data and analysed its impact on data

                2. Decrease the number of observations generated and analysed its impact on data.
WEEK03-SVM: Developed a predictive model that predicts lawn mower ownership (use the RisingMower.csv data) using SVM classification and other. saved the best model and Created an application that asks the user for an income and lot size and answers if it's predicted that this property would own a lawnmower

WEEK04-Universal Bank: Universal bank has recently trialed a marketing campaign to sell their new CD account product to existing customers. They contacted 5000 of their non-CD account customers with an offer. The data provided in universal.csv is the result of this market test. Used decision tree, SDG, and hyperparameters RandomSearchCV combined with GridSearchCV to identify the best parameters for each model tested.

WEEK05-Ensembling techniques: uisng various ensembling techniques like bagging and boosting. Random forest, Ada boost, XGboost techniques. I applied these techniques to Universal bank data set and observed the performance of each models.

WEEK06-Text Mining: Explored the impacts of applying SVD to the data. Analyzed how changing the n_components parameter impacts the modeling results. Use the values 100, 300, and 500 and how each of these values impacted the performance of the models.

WEEK07-Neural Networks: Added Neural Networks to my assignment-1 Online shopper purchasing intensions and compared normal classification models and Neural network models

WEEK08-Deep neural networks: Installed Keras library and tensorflow and applied to handwritten data set and observed the perfromance of model on my data set.

WEEK09-CNN (Convolution Neural Networks): Applied Keras deep and wide dense layer, Keras with Sklean search, Keras with Keras tune and I understoood the concept of CNN and applied to the images that contains different apples. I evaluted the perfromance of the model.

WEEK10- RNN predicted Delta Airlines stock price by RNN, LTSM, Gru, and Conv1D techniques to predict the 10th-day closing pric baseed on past nine days

WEEK-11 Autoencoders: Predicted letter by adding letter images to MNIST digits data
